## üîß **How it works**

First, you should read the [What pains does it solve?](#what-pains-does-it-solve) section to understand the pains you have with the current i18n solutions.

i18n-keyless is a library that allows you to translate your text without the need to use keys.

By calling `I18nKeyless.init` you [initialize](#setup-with-i18n-keyless-service) an object that will be used to translate your text.
If your primary language is `en` and the user's language is `fr`, the object would look like this:

```javascript
{
   "Hello!": "Bonjour !",
   "Welcome to our website": "Bienvenue sur notre site web",
   ...
}
```
If the user's language is `en`, there is no need of this object.

If the translation is not found, there will be an asynchronous fetch to I18nKeyless' API (or your own if you prefer) to get the translation by an AI API call.
Then the translation is returned and stored in the object.

At the first opening of the app ever in a new language, there is an API call to the server where all your translations are stored.
Then it stores all those translations in the object and the storage you provide (localStorage, AsyncStorage, MMKV, etc.).
No translations are stored in the app initially.

At each opening of the app, the newest translations are fetched from the storage and the object is updated.


## üîß **Installation**

Install the package via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install i18n-keyless
```

or

```bash
yarn add i18n-keyless
```

## üöÄ **Usage**

### **Component Usage**

Use the `I18nText` component to wrap your text in any supported language:

```javascript
import { I18nText } from "i18n-keyless";

<I18nText>Je mets mon texte dans ma langue, finies les cl√©s !</I18nText>
```

### **Dynamic Text Replacement**

For text with dynamic content, use the `I18nTextWithReplacement` component:

```javascript
import { I18nTextWithReplacement } from "i18n-keyless";

// Replace specific text patterns with dynamic values
<I18nTextWithReplacement 
  replace={{
    "{name}": user.name,
    "{date}": formattedDate
  }}
>
  Bonjour {name}, votre rendez-vous est confirm√© pour le {date}
</I18nTextWithReplacement>

This will first translate the entire text, then replace the placeholders with their respective values. It's perfect for dynamic content like usernames, dates, or counts.
```

### **Methods**

For translating text outside of components, use the `getTranslation` method:

```javascript
import { getTranslation } from "i18n-keyless";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <HomeTabs.Navigator>
      <HomeTabs.Screen
        options={{ tabBarLabel: getTranslation("Welcome") }}
        name="WELCOME"
      />
    </HomeTabs.Navigator>
  );
}
```

For setting a new current language, use the `setCurrentLanguage` method wherever you want:

```javascript
import { setCurrentLanguage } from "i18n-keyless";

setCurrentLanguage("en");
```

To retrieve the current language, use the `useCurrentLanguage` hook:

```javascript
import { useCurrentLanguage } from "i18n-keyless";

const currentLanguage = useCurrentLanguage();
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Setup with [i18n-keyless service](https://i18n-keyless.com)**

Here's a basic setup example to get started with i18n-keyless:

```javascript
import * as I18nKeyless from "i18n-keyless";
import myStorage from "./src/services/storage";

I18nKeyless.init({
  API_KEY: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
  storage: myStorage, // Example: MMKV, AsyncStorage, window.localStorage, or any other storage solution
  languages: {
    primary: "fr", // Set the primary language ('fr' or 'en' available by default)
    supported: ["fr", "en"], // this is what supports your app. But i18n-keyless allows also: nl,it,de,es,pl,pt,ro,sv,tr,ja,cn,ru,ko,ar. Reach out if you need more
  },
});
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Setup with your own API**

### **Using `API_URL`**

To use your own API, you need to provide the `API_URL` in the `I18nKeyless.init` configuration. Your API must implement the following routes:

-   `GET /translate/:lang`: This route should return all translations for a given language.
    **Response format to GET /translate/en:**

    ```json
    {
        "ok": true,
        "data": {
            "translations": {
                "Bonjour le monde": "Hello world",
                "Bienvenue chez nous": "Welcome to our website",
                "Au revoir": "Goodbye"    
            }
        },
        "error": null,
        "message": "" // there would be a message if the key is not valid, or whatever
    }
    ```

-   `POST /translate`: This route should accept a body with the key to translate and return the translated text.
    **Request body:**

    ```json
    {
        "key": "Bonjour le monde",
        "languages": ["en","nl","it","de","es"],
        "primaryLanguage": "fr"
    }
    ```

    **Response format:**

    ```json
    {
        "ok": true,
        "message": "" // there would be a message if the key is not valid, or whatever
    }
    ```

Here's how to configure `i18n-keyless` with your `API_URL`:

```javascript
import * as I18nKeyless from "i18n-keyless";
import myStorage from "./src/services/storage";

I18nKeyless.init({
    API_URL: "https://your-api.com",
    storage: myStorage,
    languages: {
        primary: "fr",
        supported: ["en", "fr"],
    },
});
```

### **Using `handleTranslate` and `getAllTranslations`**

Alternatively, you can provide custom functions to handle the translation and retrieval of all translations. This is useful if you want to integrate with an existing translation service or database.

```javascript
import * as I18nKeyless from "i18n-keyless";
import MyCustomText from "./src/components/MyCustomText";
import myStorage from "./src/services/storage";

async function handleTranslate(key: string) {
    // Your custom logic to translate the key
}

async function getAllTranslations() {
    // Your custom logic to fetch all translations
    // return all translations for all languages
    return {
        "ok": true,
        "data": {
            "translations": {
                "Bonjour le monde": "Hello world",
            }
        }
    }
}

I18nKeyless.init({
    storage: myStorage,
    languages: {
        primary: "fr",
        supported: ["en", "fr"],
    },
    handleTranslate: handleTranslate,
    getAllTranslations: getAllTranslations
});
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Custom Component Example**

Create a custom text component for advanced text rendering needs. I strongly advise to use a custom component, even the simplest `p` or `Text` component

```javascript
import { StyleProp, Text, TextProps, TextStyle } from "react-native";
import { I18nText } from "i18n-keyless-react";
import { colors } from "~/utils/colors";

interface MyTextProps {
  className?: string;
  style?: StyleProp<TextStyle>;
  children: string;
  color?: keyof typeof colors;
  textProps?: TextProps;
}

export default function MyText({
  className,
  style = {},
  children,
  color = "app-white",
  textProps,
}: MyTextProps) {
  return (
    <Text
      className={["text-dark dark:text-white", className].join(" ")}
      style={[style, { color: color ? colors[color] : undefined }]}
      {...textProps}
    >
      <I18nText>{children}</I18nText>
    </Text>
  );
}
```



## üîß **What pains does it solve?**

Multiple pains exist with the current i18n solutions.

### i18n key system management

Today most of the systems use keys to translate the text:

```javascript
{
   "en": {
      "hello": "Hello"
   },
   "fr": {
      "hello": "Bonjour"
   }
}
```

This is painful to generate.
This is painful to maintain.

When you see a text in the app, and you want to update it, you need to find the corresponding key, update the text, and make sure to not forget to update the key if needed.

With i18n-keyless, you don't care about the i18n system at all.

### Translation management

With the key system, you also need to manage the translations in the app. 
You need to not forget any. In all the languages you support.
You need to check manually, or create a script to do it.

With i18n-keyless, you don't care about the i18n system at all.

### Code reading

With the key system, when you read the code and the content, you have to read keys, not natural language.
So you don't really know what you are reading.
Sometimes you should make a fix because a sentence is not grammatically correct. But you don't know that because you read keys, not natural language.

With i18n-keyless, you read natural language.
So you know exactly what you are reading.
And you can make sure the sentence is grammatically correct, in real time.
